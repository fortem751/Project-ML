## 📁 File Structure

### Core Engine Files
- **game_engine.py** - Main engine, interface handler
- **search_engine.py** - Alpha-beta with PVS, null-move, LMR, aspiration
- **evaluation.py** - Pattern-based evaluation function
- **move_generator.py** - Intelligent move generation and ordering

### Advanced Components
- **opening_book.py** - Opening theory database with variations
- **zobrist_hash.py** - Zobrist hashing + transposition table
- **pattern_recognition.py** - Threat detection and tactical patterns

### Utilities
- **defines.py** - Constants and data structures
- **tools.py** - Board operations, move conversion

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# No external dependencies needed - pure Python!
# Just ensure you have Python 3.7+

# Test the engine
python game_engine.py
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Start engine
python game_engine.py

# Commands:
name          # Get engine name
new black     # Start as black
next          # Make next move
move XXXX     # Opponent moved, respond
depth 5       # Set 5 second time limit
print         # Show board
exit          # Quit
```

### Building Executable
```bash
# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Build standalone executable
pyinstaller --onefile --name ecojmb game_engine.py

# Run
./dist/ecojmb     # Linux/Mac
dist\ecojmb.exe   # Windows
```

## 🎮 Playing Against Other Engines

### Configuration
For competitive play, use these settings:

```python
# In game_engine.py __init__:
self.m_alphabeta_depth = 5  # Deep search
self.m_time_limit = 5.0     # 5 seconds per move

# Adjust based on your CPU:
# Fast CPU (i7/Ryzen): depth=6, time=8.0
# Medium CPU: depth=5, time=5.0
# Slow CPU: depth=4, time=4.0
```

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### 1. Opening Book System
```python
# The engine has built-in opening theory
# Variations include:
- Tengen (center) opening
- Diagonal approaches
- Knight's move patterns
- Balanced responses

# To add your own variations:
opening_book = OpeningBook()
opening_book.add_position(board, move, result)
opening_book.save_book('my_book.json')
```

### 2. Transposition Tables
```python
# Zobrist hashing for fast position lookup
# Stores 500,000 positions by default
# Automatic cleanup of old entries

# Configure size:
transposition_table = TranspositionTable(max_size=1000000)
```

### 3. Pattern Recognition
```python
# Detects tactical patterns:
- SIX_IN_ROW (instant win)
- FIVE_IN_ROW (one move from win)
- OPEN_FOUR (unstoppable)
- DOUBLE_FOUR (winning combination)
- OPEN_THREE (strong threat)
- Formations (2x2, diamond, bridge)


## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Typical Performance (5-second limit, depth 5)

| Phase | Nodes | Depth Reached | Threats Found |
|-------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Opening (book) | ~0 | N/A | Instant |
| Early Middle | 50K-100K | 5-6 | <0.1s |
| Middle Game | 100K-500K | 4-5 | ~1s |
| Complex Tactical | 200K-1M | 5-7 | 2-4s |
| Endgame | 300K-800K | 5-6 | ~2s |

### Expected Strength

**Against Random Play:** 100% win rate
**Against Basic AI:** 95%+ win rate
**Against Cloudict:**
- Survival: 95%+ (won't lose in opening)
- Competitive: 70%+ (holds position to move 20+)
- Winning: 30-50% (depends on position complexity)

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Run Test Suite
```python
# Test tactical strength
python test_professional.py

# Expected results:
✓ Opening book integration
✓ Immediate win detection
✓ Threat blocking
✓ Pattern recognition
✓ Transposition table
✓ Move generation
✓ Search stability
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test opening book
python game_engine.py
> new black
> next
# Should play JJ (center) instantly

# Test immediate win
> black JJKKLLMMNN  # 5 in a row
> next
# Should complete the six immediately

# Test defense
> white JJKKLLMMNN  # White threatens
> next
# Should block at OO or II
```

## 🎯 Optimization Guide

### If Engine is Too Slow
```python
# Reduce search depth
self.m_alphabeta_depth = 4  # Was 5

# Reduce move candidates
max_moves=25  # Was 35 in move_generator

# Reduce transposition table size
max_size=200000  # Was 500000

# Disable expensive features
self.use_null_move = False
self.use_lmr = False
```


## 🐛 Debugging

### Enable Debug Output
```python
# In search_engine.py, add prints:
print(f"Depth {depth}: alpha={alpha}, beta={beta}")
print(f"Move: {move2msg(move)}, Score: {score}")
print(f"TT Hit: {tt_hit}, Score: {tt_score}")
```

### Check Move Validity
```python
# In game_engine.py, after search:
print(f"Move validity check:")
print(f"Pos1: ({best_move.positions[0].x}, {best_move.positions[0].y})")
print(f"Pos2: ({best_move.positions[1].x}, {best_move.positions[1].y})")
print(f"Board[pos1]: {self.m_board[best_move.positions[0].x][best_move.positions[0].y]}")
```

### Verify Search Depth
```python
# Check nodes per depth
for d in range(max_depth):
    if self.nodes_per_depth[d] > 0:
        print(f"Depth {d}: {self.nodes_per_depth[d]} nodes")
```

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

### Real-Time Statistics
```python
# The engine prints after each move:
Time: 3.45s
Nodes: 234,567 (68,000 nps)
Score: 1250
Depth 5 completed
TT: 45,678 entries, 72.3% hit rate
```

### Interpretation
- **Nodes Per Second (NPS)**: 
  - 50K+ = Good
  - 100K+ = Excellent
  - 200K+ = Outstanding

- **TT Hit Rate**:
  - 60%+ = Working well
  - 70%+ = Excellent
  - 80%+ = Outstanding

- **Score**:
  - |score| < 10K = Balanced position
  - |score| > 50K = One side has advantage
  - |score| > 500K = Critical threats
  - |score| > 5M = Forced win/loss


### Key Algorithms
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Core search algorithm
- **Iterative Deepening**: Progressive depth increase
- **Transposition Tables**: Position caching
- **Principal Variation Search**: Optimized alpha-beta
- **Null-Move Pruning**: Fast position evaluation
- **Late Move Reductions**: Selective depth reduction
